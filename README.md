CSS-Sizer
=========

A CSS window sizer.

I got the wild hair and decided to build a window sizer based on CSS. Not really knowing if there was a feasible reason to use it rather than a few lines of script. It seems to be quite the bear and nasty to use, but interesting none the less.

Lastly, I wanted to publish here to test out my first run with GitHub!
